export default definePageConfig({

  navigationStyle: 'custom', // Custom nav bar to show banner behind? Or just default. Design says "Top Banner", so maybe custom or just standard. Let's stick to standard but maybe transparent or just white for now. Wait, prompt says "Top: Brand + Msg + Profile", so it implies a custom header.
  // "Top Banner Background (Snow Mountain)"
  // I will use custom navigation style to allow the banner to go to the top.
